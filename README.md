## Requirements


## Getting started


## Acknowledgement
This implementation is built on [DC/DSA/DM](https://github.com/VICO-UoE/DatasetCondensation) and [MTT](https://github.com/georgecazenavette/mtt-distillation). We also applied our method to [IDC](https://github.com/snu-mllab/efficient-dataset-condensation) and [FTD](https://github.com/AngusDujw/FTD-distillation) in our paper. We thank the authors and contributors of these projects.
